/*
       The code swaps the values of two variables, a and b, without using a third variable by performing arithmetic operations:
1.	a = a + b adds a and b and stores the sum in a.
2.	b = a - b subtracts the original value of b from the new a, storing it in b. Now b holds the original value of a.
3.	a = a - b subtracts the original value of a (now in b) from the sum in a, storing it in a. Now a holds the original value of b.
The end result is that the values of a and b are swapped.
