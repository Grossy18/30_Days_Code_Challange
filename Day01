 /*
The code uses a bitwise XOR operation to swap the values of two variables, a and b, without using a third variable. Here's a brief explanation:
1.	a = a ^ b; - This line XORs a with b and stores the result in a. This effectively combines the bits of a and b to create a new value for a.
2.	b = a ^ b; - Now, we XOR the new a (which contains the original value of b) with b and store the result in b. This operation essentially isolates the original value of a and assigns it to b.
3.	a = a ^ b; - Finally, we XOR the new a (which contains the original value of b) with the new b (which contains the original value of a) and store the result in a. This swaps the values completely, and a now holds the original value of b, and b holds the original value of a.
This code efficiently swaps the values of a and b without needing a third variable for temporary storage.
