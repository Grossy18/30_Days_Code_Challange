/*
1.	We start with the original string "Hello, World!".
2.	Convert the string into an array of characters. This makes it easier to work with individual characters.
3.	Initialize two pointers, left and right, which point to the start and end of the character array.
4.	Use a loop to swap characters from the left and right ends of the array. We start from the ends and move toward the center until the pointers meet.
5.	After the loop, convert the character array back to a string to get the reversed string.
6.	Finally, print the original and reversed strings to see the result.
