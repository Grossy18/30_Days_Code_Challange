/*
1.	Initialize two variables, firstMax and secondMax, to the minimum possible integer value.
2.	Loop through the array, comparing each element with firstMax and secondMax.
3.	Update firstMax and secondMax as needed to track the two largest elements.
4.	After the loop, secondMax will contain the second largest element in the array.
5.	If there is no valid second largest element (e.g., when the array has fewer than two elements), handle that case accordingly.
