//write a program how to change value of constant

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myVariable = 42; // Declare and initialize a regular variable

        // Change the value of the variable
        myVariable = 10;

        System.out.println("The value of myVariable is: " + myVariable);
    }
}


/*
In this code:

We declare a regular variable myVariable and initialize it with the value 42.

Then, we change the value of myVariable to 10 without any issues because it's not declared as a final constant.

If you truly need to change a value that should be considered constant throughout your program, it's better to use a configuration file or a settings mechanism to manage such values. Constants, by definition in Java, are meant to remain unchanged after initialization.
